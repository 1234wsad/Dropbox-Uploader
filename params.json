(dot) is printed for every chunk successfully uploaded. \r\nInstead, if an error occurs during the chunk uploading, an * (star) is printed and the upload \r\nis retried for a maximum of three times.\r\nOnly if the file is smaller than 150Mb, the standard upload API is used, and if VERBOSE is set \r\nto 1 the default curl progress bar is displayed during the upload process.\r\n\r\n* **download** [REMOTE_FILE] &lt;LOCAL_FILE&gt;  \r\nDownload file from Dropbox to local folder\r\n\r\n* **delete** [REMOTE_FILE/REMOTE_DIRECTORY]  \r\nRemove a remote file from Dropbox\r\n\r\n* **mkdir** [REMOTE_DIRECTORY]  \r\nCreate a remote directory on DropBox\r\n\r\n* **list** &lt;REMOTE_DIRECTORY&gt;  \r\nList contents of the remote Dropbox folder\r\n\r\n* **share** [REMOTE_FILE]  \r\nGet a public share link for the specified file\r\n \r\n* **info**  \r\nPrint some info about your Dropbox account\r\n\r\n* **unlink**  \r\nUnlink this script from your Dropbox account\r\n\r\n\r\n**Optional parameters:**  \r\n* **-f [FILENAME]**  \r\nLoad the configuration file from a specific file\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n```bash\r\n    ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload /etc/passwd /myfiles/passwd.old\r\n    ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload /etc/passwd\r\n    ./dropbox_uploader.sh download /backup.zip\r\n    ./dropbox_uploader.sh delete /backup.zip\r\n    ./dropbox_uploader.sh mkdir /myDir/\r\n    ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload \"My File.txt\" \"My File 2.txt\"   (File name with spaces...)\r\n    ./dropbox_uploader.sh share \"My File.txt\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tested Environments\r\n\r\n* GNU Linux\r\n* FreeBSD 8.3\r\n* MacOSX\r\n* Windows/Cygwin\r\n* Raspberry Pi\r\n* QNAP\r\n* iOS\r\n* OpenWRT\r\n\r\nIf you have successfully tested this script on others systems or platforms please let me know!\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to setup a proxy\r\n\r\nTo use a proxy server, just set the **https_proxy** environment variable:\r\n\r\n**Linux:**\r\n```bash\r\n    export HTTP_PROXY_USER=XXXX\r\n    export HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD=YYYY\r\n    export https_proxy=http://192.168.0.1:8080\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BSD:**\r\n```bash\r\n    setenv HTTP_PROXY_USER XXXX\r\n    setenv HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD YYYY\r\n    setenv https_proxy http://192.168.0.1:8080\r\n```\r\n   \r\n## BASH and Curl installation\r\n\r\n**Debian & Ubuntu Linux:**\r\n```bash\r\n    sudo apt-get install bash (Probably BASH is already installed on your system)\r\n    sudo apt-get install curl\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BSD:**\r\n```bash\r\n    cd /usr/ports/shells/bash && make install clean\r\n    cd /usr/ports/ftp/curl && make install clean\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Cygwin:** \r\nYou need to install these packages:  \r\n* curl\r\n* ca-certificates\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build cURL from source:**\r\n* Download the source tarball from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html\r\n* Follow the INSTALL instructions\r\n   \r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nThe first time you use Dropbox Uploader, you have to run these commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n $chmod +x dropbox_uploader.sh\r\n $./dropbox_uploader.sh\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
